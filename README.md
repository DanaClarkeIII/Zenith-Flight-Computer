This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all publicly accessible information and resources related to the Zenith Flight Computer. As part of my commitment to comply with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), I have deliberately excluded any software related to flight path control or targeting from this repository.

The Zenith Flight Computer has been primarily designed and built for model rocketry enthusiasts. This cutting-edge technology is perfect for hobbyists and professional rocketry projects alike, offering numerous capabilities to enrich the model rocketry experience. However, please be aware that although I aim to equip rocketry aficionados with advanced resources, I strictly adhere to legal and ethical boundaries, thus avoiding any potential misuse or violation of regulations.
